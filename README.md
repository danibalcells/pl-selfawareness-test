# Arnold: measuring self-awareness in LLMs

This repo contains my submission for a 24-hour take-home assignment as part of my application for Plastic Labs.

The challenge is:

> Create a prompt (or set of prompts) designed to elicit some degree of 'self-awareness' from an LLM. Then develop a method to classify these responses on a spectrum of perceived self-awareness.

You can find an interactive notebook explaining my approach [here](https://danibalcells.github.io/pl-selfawareness-test/notebooks/arnold.html).

The repo is structured as follows:
 - `/arnold` contains the solution, structured as a Python module.
 - `/notebooks` contains `arnold.ipynb`, which was used to create the Jupyter Book linked above, as well as `playground.ipynb`, which I used as a scratchpad during my experimentation.
